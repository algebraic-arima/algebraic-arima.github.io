I am a second-year undergraduate student 
at [ACM Honor Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), Shanghai Jiao
Tong University.
Before being admitted to ACM Honor class,
I studied at [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index), Shanghai 
Jiao Tong University.

I am interested in algebra, theoretical cryptography, and formal verification.

Recently I learned something about TEEs and found it interesting; but I have a lot more to explore in this area.
